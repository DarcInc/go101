Archives are files that contain other files.  In Go the two 
'batteries included' archive formats are zip files and 
tar files.  Using these archive formats you can do things like:

1. Generate downloadable zip and tar files on the fly.
2. Write data to archives from databases without creating an intermediate file.
3. Create a backup format by leveraging the tar or zip structure.
4. Read tar files on Windows!
