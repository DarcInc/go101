## Zip Files
Zip files are a more recent archive format dating from the late
1980's.  Unlike tar, zip files are supported on Windows.  Zip is
often used to distribute archives of files on the internet 
because it is supported in most *nix distributions and on Windows.
Unlike tar files, zip files are a compressed format.  For more
